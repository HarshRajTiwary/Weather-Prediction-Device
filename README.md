# Weather-Prediction-Device
Developed ML model and deployed on esp32 which uses DHT11 sensor to get temperature and humidity with this it calculates heat index and then predicts weather condition.

# **Introduction to Machine Learning with Jupyter Notebooks**
Welcome to the world of Machine Learning. This instructional materials will guide you to learn machine learning using Jupyter Notebook.

## **Getting Started**
### **1. Setting Up Your Environment**
Before we go deep into machine learning, you'll need to set up your environment.
follow these steps to set up your environment.

**Install Jupyter Notebook**:

Install the classic Jupyter Notebook by writting the below command in your terminal:

`pip install notebook`

### **2. Launching Jupyter Notebook**

To run the notebook:

`jupyter notebook`

or if this doesnt work, write this insteade.

`python -m notebook`

## **Basics of Machain Learning (ML)**
### **What is Machine Learning?**
It is a subset of Artificial Inteligence (AI). It focuses on making a model capable of learning from data to make predictions or decisions.

### **Types of Machaine Learning:**
1. *Supervised Learning*: Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
2. *Unsupervised Learning*: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
3. *Reinforcement Learning*: Learning through rewards and punishments.

## **Building your first ML Model**

**Task**: Develop a weather forecasting model capable of predicting
weather conditions, including sunny, cloudy, rainy, foggy, etc.

**Objective**:
Develop instructional materials for students to learn machine learning using
Jupyter Notebook and other ML tools. Use a weather forecasting model as an
example, incorporating TensorFlow and a Decision Tree Classifier. The aim is
to accurately predict weather conditions and display predictions such as
sunny, cloudy, rainy, and foggy.

**Tools and Technologies**:
1. *Jupyter Notebook*: For data preprocessing, model development, and
training.
2. *Programming Language*: Python - Widely used for its simplicity,
extensive libraries, and ecosystem support.
3. *TensorFlow*: For building and training the weather prediction model.
4. *NumPy*: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
5. *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
